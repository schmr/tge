Overview: 
--------- 
This file contains a description of the motivation behind this tool,
installation instructions, and a disclaimer.  It is important to read the
disclaimer before compiling or using the task graph extraction tool.  The
tool is provided AS-IS with no explicit or implied warranty with the hope
that people in the research or other communities will find it useful.

Motivation:
-----------
Embedded systems are becoming increasingly complicated, requiring more
time for design. To alleviate this problem, more sophisticated design
tools are necessary to aid the designer in his task. These tools are used
from low-level physical synthesis to high-level hardware/software
co-synthesis. While tools at the lower levels are rather mature, the tools
at the HW/SW co-synthesis level are just being developed. Part of their
limitations are that they often require input in the form of a task graph
and embedded systems are often designed in languages such as C. Manual
converting from C to task graphs is time-consuming, difficult and can
cause errors. The task graph extraction tool aims to aid in solving this
problem by automatically generating task graphs from C source code.
